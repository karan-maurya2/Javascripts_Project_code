 <!-- console  -->
 We will use console.log() as a tool to test our code.
 console.log() simply displays information in your JavaScript console or  also used console.log() to access this value.


<!-- template literals:-  Its  the part 2015 ecma scripts or es6-->
New way to denotes string in javascripts by using backticks(` `) or template literals

<!-- Note -->
Semi colon is option in javascripts.


<!-- variable -->
In real case scenario we may need to store and use data in program not just print, 
to store data and  use them in later in program , we can used variable.

Variables are containers that store information for later use.

<!-- let language ="javascripts" -->

here "let" is used to create variable (language) and it has string data "javascripts"
And to store data in variable , we use assignment operator " = "


<!-- So far, we have created our variables with the let keyword. -->
let test = 5;

<!-- You can also create a variable with the const keyword. -->
const test = 5;

<!-- The difference between the two(let & const) is that
 you can not assign a new value to a variable that was created with const. -->
 const num = 2;
 num = 6;
 console.log(num);


 <!-- You also cannot declare a const-variable without assigning a value to it directly. -->
 const num;
num = 5;
console.log(num);


 <!-- But, why should you use const instead of let? -->
 It is considered good practice to use const for variables whoose value will never change.
 const pi = 3.14159;


 <!-- Introduction to conditional statements -->
JavaScript conditional allow you to write dynamic and
 interactive programs that can respond to user input and other changing variables. Let's have a look at how they work.
<!--  
 let temperature = 80;
 console.log(`the temperature is  ${temperature}`);

 if (temperature > 70) {
     console.log("Outside weather is warm");   
 } -->

 The if-statement executes a block of code if a certain condition is true.
It consists of the if keyword followed by a condition in parentheses, and a block of code in curly braces.

 if (Condition) {
  Block of code
 }

 <!-- Functions - parameters and arguments (1) -->
 When you call a function in JavaScript, you can pass values to the function.
  These values are called arguments. In order to access these arguments, functions can define parameters.
   Parameters are variables that contain the values of the arguments passed to the function.

   
const multiply = function (num) {
    return num * num;
 };
  
 const arg = 5;
  
 const result = multiply(arg);
 console.log(result === 25);


 <!-- Create a JavaScript array -->
 In this exercise, we will create our first JavaScript array. In the code below we declare an array named arr using the so called literal notation.
  The literal notation is a pair or square brackets that enclose the values that we want to put inside the array: [value, value, ...]. 
 Each value is separated by a comma. In the context of an array, these values are called the elements of the array.
